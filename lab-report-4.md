## Part 2 ##
* The time it took me make the edits on the local and copy it onto my remote took me about 1:09. 
* A problem I ran to was typing speed in that it took a long time to type out all the commands such as scp'ing, and logging into the remote server and navigating through the directory to run the bash file. 
* Editing the file on the remote alone, took me about 50 seconds, there was really no problem as all the commands were sequential and no copying was needed.
* I prefer working on the vim when I want to be more efficient with my time as I can avoid copying from the local to the remote.
* A project or task that requires precision in coding may be more better on the local as the interface is easier to look at and a lot more less prone to mistakes than working within a vim. I believe that IDEs such as VSCode are a lot easier to look at when coding, so I believe that if I want to work on a program for a prolonged period of time I prefer the local.
