**/paths** 

![Image](1.png)
* Searches for the first occurence of paths with the / command.

**enter**

![Image](2.png)
* Jumps to the beginning of the word where it was found.

**K**
![Image](3.png)
* Moves up one line with the K key

**e(1)**
![Image](4.png)
* Moves to the end of each word

**e(2)** 
![Image](5.png)
* Moves to end of the other word the cursor is on

**e(3)** 
![Image](6.png)
* Finally moves to the end of the line but not the next availabe space

**I**
![Image](7.png)
* Enters Insert Mode where changes can be made to the contents of the file itself

**Right Arrow**
![Image](8.png)
* Moves to the next available space where contents can be added

**Enter**
![Image](9.png)
* Moves to the next line freeing up space to add contents

**System.out.println(f.toString() + " is a directory");**
![Image](10.png)
* Adds the change required to print out that the directory file is a directory

**ESC**
![Image](11.png)
* Exits out of Insert Mode

**:wq**

![Image](12.png)
* Saves the changes made to the file and quits out of vim

![Image](13.png)
* After pressing enter to the command, :wq

## Part 2 ##
* The time it took me make the edits on the local and copy it onto my remote took me about 1:09. 
* A problem I ran to was typing speed in that it took a long time to type out all the commands such as scp'ing, and logging into the remote server and navigating through the directory to run the bash file. 
* Editing the file on the remote alone, took me about 50 seconds, there was really no problem as all the commands were sequential and no copying was needed.
* I prefer working on the vim when I want to be more efficient with my time as I can avoid copying from the local to the remote.
* A project or task that requires precision in coding may be more better on the local as the interface is easier to look at and a lot more less prone to mistakes than working within a vim. I believe that IDEs such as VSCode are a lot easier to look at when coding, so I believe that if I want to work on a program for a prolonged period of time I prefer the local.
