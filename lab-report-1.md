# Lab Report 1 #
## Setting up Visual Code ##

* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
![Image](vscode.png)
* Follow the link and follow the download button specific to your OS.
* Set up VSCode specific to the programming langauge you want, in this case it's Java.
* In this case, VSCode was already downloaded so I cannot provide further steps.

## Remotely Connection ##
* First you want to open the terminal within VSCode and type in ssh cs15lfa22xx@ieng6.ucsd.edu.
* Remember to replace xx with the two letters that correspond to your personal user account that can be found on UCSD account lookup.
* If you follow the steps correctly, the terminal should look like this.

## Run Some Commands ##
* Next it's important to test out some commands within your terminal now that you're logged into the ssh.
* Some things that are nice to test out are what would be ls, cd, and a more advanced command.

* In this screenshot, the command "ls" shows the current files or content in your directory. "cd" navigates through directories and "cat" prints files. Perl5 currently has no files in the remote server but serves as a sub-directoy in the home directoy.

## Moving Files over SSH with scp ##
* First we want to move files from the local computer to a remote server with the command "scp".
* We want to first create a class called WhereAmI where it would summarize our identity.

![Image](whereamI.png)
* As you can see we compile the file with "javac", and then run the file with "java"
* Now we want to move this file from our local system to our remote server.
* We want to use the command (scp WhereAmI.java cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/)
![Image](scp.png)
* As you can see the file is moved and when "ls" is inputted it's in our remote server's directory.

## SSH Keys ##
* We want to create a private and public key that will allow us to login into our remote server seamlessly without having to type in our password everytime.
* First we want to log onto our remote server using **ssh cs15lfa22zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu**
* After logging in we want to make a .ssh folder in our remote server files to store the key.
![Image](ssh_folder.png)
* We will use the command $ ssh-keygen on our local computer first, which will create the key.
![Image](ssh-key].png)
* Next we will transfer our local key saved and save it onto our remove server.
* You want to use scp and the location of your key and for my case would be C:\Users\twist/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
![Image](ssh.png)
* We now log into the remote server and now no password is needed.


## Making Remote Running Even More Pleasant ##
* We want to shortcut some tasks by running our previous commands with the same time as opening the remote server.
* Using the original command **ssh cs15lfa22xx@ieng6.ucsd.edu** followed with a basic command like "ls" we can get the list of the directory and login to the remote server at the same time.
![Image](more_commands.png)
* With this command, it allows you to execute commands within the remote server, HOWEVER, it does not log you into the server itself.   

**That wraps up our tutorial for getting familiar with ssh and seeing what you can do within the terminal.**
